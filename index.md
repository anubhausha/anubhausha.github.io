I am a graduate student in the Information PhD program at the University of Michigan. 

My research lies at the intersection of labor and automation. By centering workers' persepectives, I study food delivery platforms in India where I explore how algorithmic management of intermediary tech platforms interact with the informal labor marekts of the Global South. My academic advisors are [Dr. Silvia Lindtner](http://www.silvialindtner.com/) and [Dr. Patricia Garcia](https://patriciagarcia.info/).

Prior to my PhD, I was a Commonwealth Scholar at SOAS (University of London) where I completed my M.A. in Global Digital Cultures and worked closely with [Dr. Elisa Oreglia](http://www.ercolino.eu/index.html) as a research assistant at Dept. of Digital Humanities, King's College London. In the past, I have managed collaborative projects with feminist human rights organizations in India exploring ICT use for Sexuality and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights related information dissemination in communities with low Internet access.
