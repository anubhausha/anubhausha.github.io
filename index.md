I am a graduate student in the Information PhD program at the University of Michigan. My research lies at the intersection of labor, automation, and datafication. I study food delivery platforms in India where I explore algorithmic management of the informal labor pool in the Global South by on-demand tech platforms. I specifically focus on the position of food delivery workers in the heteromated workflows of food delivery platforms in India.

My academic advisors are [Dr. Silvia Lindtner](http://www.silvialindtner.com/) and [Dr. Patricia Garcia](https://patriciagarcia.info/).

Prior to my PhD, I was a Commonwealth Scholar at SOAS (University of London) where I completed my M.A. in Global Digital Cultures and worked closely with Dr. Elisa Oreglia as a research assistant at Dept. of Digital Humanities, King's College London. In the past, I have managed collaborative projects with feminist human rights organizations in India exploring ICT use for Sexuality and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights related information dissemination in communities with low Internet access.
